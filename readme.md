## Meaningbot For Meaningwave Discord Channel

This is a Discord bot build for the Meaningwave Discord group. It is to replace to out-of-service Echo bot.

The bot will take commands from #the-path channel. It will DM the user to remind them to stay on the path. On command request, the bot will also post messages to remind us stay on the path.

## Commands

```
!commit - set a commitment or goal to get after it
!remindme [daily/semiweekly/weekly/biweekly/monthly/never] - set the interval of how often the user is reminded to stay on the path
!update - update the bot (and the community) on the current progress
